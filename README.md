# COVID 19 Dashboard

## Introdution 
  Hello everyone! This is the COVID 19 Dashboard that we started with my team on EPAM courses, and I'm currently working on it alone. At the moment, you can use the search to find the desired country, use various filters (total died, died today, deaths per 100 thousand of the country's population, and more), there is a distribution graph, an interactive map with visual effects for better perception.
